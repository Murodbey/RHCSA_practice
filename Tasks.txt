Resizing done while the file system is still mounted and in-use. The volume group extended to include an
additional physical volumne of 512MB giving a total volume group of 1GB.
	23. Resize logical volume 800MB total called storage in the volume group shazam, mounted at /storage.
Resizing done while the file system is still mounted and in-use
